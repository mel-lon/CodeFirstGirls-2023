# The first test case tests for a simple isogram word to ensure that the function correctly identifies an isogram.
# The second test case tests for a word with repeated characters to ensure that the function correctly identifies a non-isogram.
# The third test case tests for a word with both uppercase and lowercase letters to ensure that the function correctly handles case-insensitivity.
# The fourth test case tests for a word with special characters to ensure that the function correctly handles non-alphabetic characters.
# The fifth test case tests for an empty string to ensure that the function correctly handles empty inputs.
# The sixth test case tests for a string with only spaces to ensure that the function correctly handles inputs consisting only of whitespace characters.
# The seventh test case tests for a string with a mix of letters and spaces to ensure that the function correctly handles inputs with whitespace characters.
